            <h2>About Scott Zhou</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in countryside of Shanghai. Everyday is a summer's day in my childhood which have a lot of funs. Latter I then came to Guilin (You might had ever heard this beautiful city) for college, receiving a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://international.guet.edu.cn/english/">Guilin University of Electronic Technology</a>, and met my wife Sophia there. I living in north countryside of Stockholm now with my wife and two kids and I work for <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/">Ericsson AB Sweden</a> as a software engineer.

                In 2005, I founded Pippin Technology at Shanghai, and this company was been merged into UD Technology latter. At the time in Pippin we aiming to create a software streaming media server based on general hardware platform (no depend on any DSP chip). From technic view we got big success but from commercial view we failed.

                I loves different sports. I'm always fell very easy to start as a beginer on a new sport but it's very difficult for me to be expert. I will change my interesting very soon after I pass the beginer phase. Maybe I just don't have tanent on sports but it wouldn't stop me to have funs.
