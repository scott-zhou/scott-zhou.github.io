            <h2>About Scott Zhou</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up from countryside of Shanghai. It tooks me quite a while to see this city growed up and finally became the best city of the world, until I left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Latter I then went to Guilin (You might had ever heard this beautiful city) for college, receiving a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://international.guet.edu.cn/english/">Guilin University of Electronic Technology</a>, and met my wife Sophia there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am living in Stockholm now with my wife and two kids. I work for <a href="https://hmgroup.com">H&M</a> in it's <a href="https://hmgroup.com/news/flying-high-with-ai-dealing-with-data-the-best-possible-way/">AI foundation</a> as a Senior Software Developer Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2005 I founded Pippin Technology in Shanghai, later this company was acquired by UD Technology. At the time in Pippin, we ambition to create a pure software streaming media server based on a general PC platform (no dependency on any DSP chip). We were doing quite well on the technical part but failed badly on the commercial.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'm working for H&M AI foundation team to landing artificial intelligence technologies for this fashion company. AI is not just about playing chess, in such a company as H&M, I got the chance to utilize its huge amount of historical data and make big impacts. I like programming in different languages and try different technology, which keeps me learning and moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I love different sports. I always feel very easy to start as a beginner at a new sport but it's very difficult for me to be an expert. I will change my interest very soon after I pass the beginner phase. Maybe I just don't have a talent for sports but it wouldn't stop me to have funs.
